/*
 Your webhook must return a JSON response:
 
 Success response:
 {
   "result": "Hello from webhook!"
 }
 
 Error response:
 {
   "code": 141,
   "error": "Something went wrong"
 }
 
 The result field contains the return value sent to the client.
 Error responses should use Parse error codes for consistency.
